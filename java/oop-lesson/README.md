# OOP Lesson - Thurs, Jan 28 2021

## Object-Oriented Programming

Object-Oriented Programming describes a methodology where a data structure known as an object is used for basic functionality.

These objects will be constructed via a structure known as a class. Classes can be thought of as blueprints for your objects. 

OOP helps us translate and manipulate real-world objects into code in a manageable fashion. 

In a class, it is considered best practice to have all fields set to private. When we want to create a new object from a class, we have to use the following syntax:

```java
MyClass myClass = new MyClass();
```

This is similar to how we typically declare and initialize variables. The first `MyClass` is the type of the variable. The lowercase `myClass` is the variable name or reference. `new` is the keyword utilized to invoke a class' constructor. `MyClass()` is a reference to the constructor itself. 

## The Four Principles

There are four major principles associated with OOP. These principle are critical to understanding OOP and objects in general. They are as follows:

1. Abstraction - this refers to when data access is simplified and removed from a user. "Take a relative complex system and simplify for our use."
2. Encapsulation
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism

## Notes 

- _Gradle_ is what's known as a _build tool_. It allows for easy configuration, building, code-sharing, and testing. It also provides easy tooling for dev-ops.
